## General Information
- What is the background of your project?

In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.

For many incumbent operators, retaining high profitable customers is the number one business
goal. To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn. In this project, you will analyze customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn.

- What is the business problem that your project is trying to solve?

The main goal of the case study is to build ML models to predict churn. The predictive model that youâ€™re going to build will the following purposes:

It will be used to predict whether a high-value customer will churn or not, in near future (i.e. churn phase). By knowing this, the company can take action steps such as providing special plans, discounts on recharge etc.

It will be used to identify important variables that are strong predictors of churn. These variables may also indicate why customers choose to switch to other networks.

Even though overall accuracy will be your primary evaluation metric, you should also mention other metrics like precision, recall, etc. for the different models that can be used for evaluation purposes based on different business objectives. For example, in this problem statement, one business goal can be to build an ML model that identifies customers who'll definitely churn with more accuracy as compared to the ones who'll not churn. Make sure you mention which metric can be used in such scenarios.

 Recommend strategies to manage customer churn based on your observations.
 
## Steps Followed:
 
Below steps are follwed to solve the problem :

- Data Understanding, Preparation, and Pre-Processing :
  - Data understanding, identification of potentially useful and non-useful attributes and variable importance and impact estimation
  - Data preparation, performing data cleaning, missing values imputation, outlier removal, and column level standardization (for e.g., date, etc.) into     one format
 
- Exploratory Data Analysis :
  - Performing basic preliminary data analysis including finding the correlation between variables and scatter plots to identify relationships between variables
  - Performing advanced data analysis, including plotting relevant heatmaps, histograms, and basic clustering to find patterns in the data
 
- Feature Engineering and Variable Transformation :
  - Feature engineering and performing one or more methods on attributes that can lead to the creation of a new potentially useful variable; for e.g., day from the date
  - Variable transformation and applying categorical variable transformations to turn into numerical data and numerical variable transformations to scale data
 
- Model Selection, Model Building, and  Prediction :
   - Identifying the type of problem and making a list of decisive models from all available choices
   - Choosing a training mechanism; for e.g., cross-validation, etc., and tuning hyperparameters of each model
   - Testing each model on the respective model evaluation metric
   - Choosing the best model based on the fit of the data set and output variable
  -  Using ensemble options to improve the efficacy based on the evaluation metric stated in the problem
 
- What is the dataset that is being used?

Dataset names train.csv is used. The dataset contains 69999 rows and 172 columns.
